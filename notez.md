## Notes

### Self-reflection: Course 1, moudle 2
1. What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

2. What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

- A good reflection on this topic would consider the phases that data goes through in its life cycle and how this impacts the data analysis process.

- While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

- The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.

## The six data analysis phase

#### Step 1: Ask
- define the problem you're trying to solve
- make sure you fully understand the stakeholder's expectations
- collaborate with the stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context.

##### question to ask yourself in this step
- what are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
- Now that I've identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

#### Step 2: Prepare
- what metrics to measure
- Locate data in your satabase
- Create security measures to protect that data

##### question to ask yourself in this step
- what do I need to figure out how to solve this problem
- what research do I need to do

#### Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible erros. inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.

- Using spreadsheet function to find incorrectly entered data
- Using SQL function to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries
- Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

##### question to ask yourself in this step  
- what data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve.
- How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?
