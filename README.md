While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.
